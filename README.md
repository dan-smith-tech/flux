# Flux Wrapper

A simple wrapper for the [Flux image generation model by Black Forest Labs](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev), featuring the following:

1. A simple interactive CLI for entering the prompt and image settings.

2. The previous model input prompt, settings, and output filename are cached for the next execution.

3. Each generated image is saved inside the `output` directory.
